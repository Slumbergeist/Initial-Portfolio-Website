                            <p class="skill-about">While spending all my time on the internet, I figured I would enjoy learning what makes it all work. And I do! I've spent a lot of time on programming in general, and it's been satisfying to explore how to apply that in web development. I always appreciate a new way to express creativity and even if I'm still learning a lot, I feel confident in my ability to learn on the go and create products that reflect what you need with a little accent of me :)</p><br>

                            <p class="skill-future">As I progress, I fully intend to make this a core income. I want to help develop websites whether that is part of a large team, or freelancing for smaller companies or individuals. My goal is to not only become proficient in front-end and back-end web development, but also be efficient at applying effective SEO and accessibility features. Whoever you are attracting to your site, everybody should find it easy to find and easy to understand!</p>

                            <p class="skill-about">I've spent my whole life growing up playing video games and I've always favored games that let me be creative whether it be The Sims or Minecraft or SimCity or whatever. So working on developing skills to create my very own game to my own standards has always been a dream of mine. I've found progress in working with Godot and I am always thinking up new ideas and concepts for interesting games whether they are developed just by me, or by a team.</p><br>

                            <p class="skill-future">I am always thinking up game concepts and once I have solid ideas, I start fleshing out and detailing how the game would work and what the specific mechanics would be. I fully intend to work on many of my game ideas from very simple ideas to full, in-depth games. I enjoy most aspects of game development even though I may not be proficient in them yet. Programming, art design, level design, music, sound effects, etc. These all really interest me and any time I can experiment and develop these skills, I really appreciate the opportunity.</p>

                            <p class="skill-about">I've always wanted to be good at drawing as another form of expression and creation, but I never quite landed on any particular medium until I started working with pixel art. Similarly, because I enjoy gaming, I also found this form of drawing to be very satisfying to me. As I progressed in game development things, I was able to not only practice and apply pixel art, but also started getting into 3d modelling as well. The old school, low poly look, similar to that of the Playstaion 1 era is some of my favorite type of modelling to work on!</p><br>

If I was able to get to a place where I could freelance some of these things or develop asset packs, that would also be ideal.</p>

                            <p class="skill-about">Music has been an important part of my life since I was young and I've always had a strong connection to it. I've similarly enjoyed writing poetry here and there throughout my life and sometimes adapting that into something more akin to lyrics. Lately it has become an increasingly more significant goal for me to try to write my own music, even if it is simple. I haven't been very consistent in the past with practicing playing guitar, but it has been over 10 years since I have started playing, so I have become increasingly comfortable with the instrument. I've also experimented with several audio/music editing and mixing programs and even though I am far from proficient in any of them, I am confident in my ability to use it for any projects I work on.</p><br>

                            <p class="skill-future">I occasionally write down poems or lyrics I may think of as well as try to record any brief snippets of riffs or any sort of rhythm or beat I may feel with the goal of eventually piecing them together into a full song. Still early on in my development here, but I am excited at the prospect of putting my own emotions and experiences into my own music that will hopefully be able to resonate with others as well!</p>
